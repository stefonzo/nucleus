Nucleus intends to be the foundation of a 2D game engine for the PSP.
Ultimately I would like to use it to try and make a Spelunky clone for the PSP (original Spelunky).

Shout out to IridescentRose and his tutorial on PSP gpu programming series on youtube! 
Please check out his tutorial, link below:

So far I've just taken his code and converted it from c -> c++ (using classes instead of structs and having the constructors/destructors handle memory allocation)
	
You'll need the PSPSDK to build this code with the provided makefile, link to PSPSDK below:
